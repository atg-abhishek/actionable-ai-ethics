The Global Internet Forum for Counter-Terrorism is a cross-company group that helps to share information across some of the major tech providers to combat illegal online hate speech. They regularly share information with each other to help increase the efficacy of their content moderation efforts. 

> As the amount of user-generated content (UGC) goes up in volume, the ability to effectively utilize community and human moderation is diminished and we have to rely on automated content moderation.

### What are the key challenges in commercial content moderation? 

* the human cost: subjecting the reviewers to traumatic content on a frequent cadence leads to long-term psychological harm
* what constitutes "valid" content is determined by a homogenous set of people in Silicon Valley that affects people all around the world 
* a potential lack of transparency and accountability, especially when things go wrong. 

### What are some of the reasons precipitating the need to utilize AI for content moderation? 

* very large amount of UGC 
* short response times dictated by legislations, for example the NetzDG or the EU Code of Conduct on Hate Speech, that necessitate the use of AI to meet those requirements. 

### What is algorithmic moderation? 

An important point made in the paper pointing to prior work by Grimmelmann talks about how moderation is not just the act of administrators and others involved in the moderation process to remove content, but it also includes the design decisions that are made for the platform that dictate how users interact with each other. 

_In this paper when the term algorithmic moderation is used, it refers to algorithmic commercial content moderation._

This refers to the act of either doing _prediction_ or _matching_ that leads to a decision or governance outcomes related to the piece of content and the parties involved. As an example, it could be taking down the content, geoblocking, suspension of accounts, among other actions. 

Again, in this paper, the focus is on **hard moderation** which refers to actions like taking down content and blocking accounts vs. **soft moderation** which refers to design decisions, recommendation algorithms, and other approaches that are used to govern the interactions between content and users on a platform.

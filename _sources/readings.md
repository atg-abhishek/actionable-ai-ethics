On the following pages, you will find summaries and insights on [papers, articles,](papers.md)  and [books](books.md) (well this will have more than just books in AI ethics!) that I find interesting in the domain of AI ethics. 

*Short summaries and questions will also be posted on the book's [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/actionable_ai)*

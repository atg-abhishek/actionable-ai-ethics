The Global Internet Forum for Counter-Terrorism is a cross-company group that helps to share information across some of the major tech providers to combat illegal online hate speech. They regularly share information with each other to help increase the efficacy of their content moderation efforts. 

> As the amount of user-generated content (UGC) goes up in volume, the ability to effectively utilize community and human moderation is diminished and we have to rely on automated content moderation.

Relying on the members of the community in a distributed manner to self-moderate the content that is created and distributed on a platform.

### What are the key challenges in commercial content moderation? 

* the human cost: subjecting the reviewers to traumatic content on a frequent cadence leads to long-term psychological harm
* what constitutes "valid" content is determined by a homogenous set of people in Silicon Valley that affects people all around the world 
* a potential lack of transparency and accountability, especially when things go wrong.
